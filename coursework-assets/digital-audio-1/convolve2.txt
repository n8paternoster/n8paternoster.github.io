function [ y ] = convolve2(x, h)% This function utilizes the convolution theorem and the FFT.% First the input vectors are padded with 0's to be the same length. Then% they undergo the FFT. the resultant vectors are multiplied and the final% result undergoes the inverse FFT.a = [x, zeros(1,length(h)-1)];b = [h, zeros(1,length(x)-1)];c = fft(a);d = fft(b);y = c.*d;y = ifft(y);end
